## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I struggled with this project. I am still trying to understand CSS positioning and I'm not very confident about it. However, I managed to get the popup div to overlay the under div when it is clicked on, and I successfully aligned my divs as I wanted. I definitely need more practice with CSS positioning. JavaScript wasn't too difficultâ€”I was able to add the hidden class to my button along with the active styles.

```css
.share-box {
  width: 248px;
  height: 55px;
  background-color: hsl(217, 19%, 35%);
  border-radius: 10px;
  color: #fff;
  position: absolute;
  left: 224px;
  bottom: 64px;
  box-shadow: 0px 4px 4px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);
}
```

```js
shareButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  shareBox.classList.toggle("hidden");
  shareButton.classList.toggle("active");
});
```

### Continued development

I want to continue working with CSS positioning in order to improve my understanding. Additionally, I plan to practice using Javascript to enhance my skills.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3Shools is the place I find anything I want to find out how to use. This time it was understanding CSS positioning.
- [Google](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjunvn4xP3-AhX4j4kEHS7LCRwQPAgJ) - You can find almost anything on Google. It helped me get used to using position in my CSS.
